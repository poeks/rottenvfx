{"name":"Rottenvfx","tagline":"A mashup of http://vimeo.com/87518452 and their Rotten Tomato scores.","body":"This is a mashup of [The Most influential VFX Movies Compilation (Extended version)](http://vimeo.com/87518452) from Roger Serrabassa and their Rotten Tomatoes score, using the handy Rotten Tomatoes API.\r\n\r\n### The Codez?\r\nIf you want to run this yourself, they [are here at rottenvfx](http://github.com/poeks/rottenvfx).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJen Oslislo (@poeks) made this thing.\r\n\r\n### 10,000 B.C. (2008)\r\nRotten 8%\r\nWith attention strictly paid to style instead of substance, or historical accuracy, 10,000 B.C. is a visually impressive but narratively flimsy epic.\r\n\r\n### 2012 (2009)\r\nRotten 39%\r\nRoland Emmerich's 2012 provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.\r\n\r\n### 300 (2007)\r\nFresh 60%\r\nA simple-minded but visually exciting experience, full of blood, violence, and ready-made movie quotes.\r\n\r\n### After Earth (2013)\r\nRotten 11%\r\nAfter Earth is a dull, ploddingly paced exercise in sentimental sci-fi -- and the latest setback for director M. Night Shyamalan's once-promising career.\r\n\r\n### Alice in Wonderland (1951)\r\nFresh 77%\r\nA good introduction to Lewis Carroll's classic, Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon's most surreal and twisted images.\r\n\r\n### Alive (1993)\r\nFresh 68%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Armageddon (1997)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Avatar (2009)\r\nCertified Fresh 83%\r\nIt might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\r\n\r\n### Battle: Los Angeles (2011)\r\nRotten 35%\r\nOverlong and overly burdened with war movie cliches, Battle: Los Angeles will entertain only the most ardent action junkies.\r\n\r\n### Battleship (2012)\r\nRotten 34%\r\nIt may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but Battleship is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material.\r\n\r\n### Big Ass Spider! (2013)\r\nFresh 78%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)\r\nCertified Fresh 79%\r\nWith plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.\r\n\r\n### Children of Men (2006)\r\nCertified Fresh 93%\r\nChildren of Men works on every level: as a violent chase thriller, a fantastical cautionary tale, and a sophisticated human drama about societies struggling to live. This taut and thought-provoking tale may not have the showy special effects normally found in movies of this genre, but you won't care one bit after the story kicks in, about a dystopic future where women can no longer conceive and hope lies within one woman who holds the key to humanity's survival. It will have you riveted.\r\n\r\n### The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 76%\r\nWith first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.\r\n\r\n### Clash of the Titans (1981)\r\nFresh 66%\r\nA goofy, old-school sword-and-sandal epic, Clash of the Titans mines Greek mythology for its story and fleshes it out with Ray Harryhausen's charmingly archaic stop-motion animation techniques.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Atlas (2012)\r\nFresh 66%\r\nIts sprawling, ambitious blend of thought-provoking narrative and eye-catching visuals will prove too unwieldy for some, but the sheer size and scope of Cloud Atlas are all but impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\n### Cloverfield (2008)\r\nCertified Fresh 77%\r\nA sort of Blair Witch Project crossed with Godzilla, Cloverfield is economically paced, stylistically clever, and filled with scares.\r\n\r\n### Cowboys & Aliens (2011)\r\nRotten 44%\r\nDaniel Craig and Harrison Ford are as dependably appealing as ever, but they're let down by director Jon Favreau's inability to smooth Cowboys & Aliens' jarring tonal shifts.\r\n\r\n### Dante's Peak (1997)\r\nRotten 27%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deep Impact (1998)\r\nRotten 47%\r\n\r\n\r\n### District 9 (2009)\r\nCertified Fresh 90%\r\nTechnically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.\r\n\r\n### Dredd (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nFueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, Dredd 3D is a rare example of a remake that actually works.\r\n\r\n### Elysium (2013)\r\nFresh 68%\r\nAfter the heady sci-fi thrills of District 9, Elysium is a bit of a comedown for director Neill Blomkamp, but on its own terms, it delivers just often enough to satisfy.\r\n\r\n### Ender's Game (2013)\r\nFresh 61%\r\nIf it isn't quite as thought-provoking as the book, Ender's Game still manages to offer a commendable number of well-acted, solidly written sci-fi thrills.\r\n\r\n### Fast & Furious 6 (2013)\r\nFresh 68%\r\nWith high-octane humor and terrific action scenes, Fast & Furious 6 builds upon the winning blockbuster formula that made Fast 5 a critical and commercial success.\r\n\r\n### Final Destination 5 (2011)\r\nFresh 61%\r\nIt's still only for the gore-thirsty faithful, but Final Destination 5 represents a surprising return to form for the franchise.\r\n\r\n### Flight (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nRobert Zemeckis makes a triumphant return to live-action cinema with Flight, a thoughtful and provocative character study propelled by a compelling performance from Denzel Washington.\r\n\r\n### G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)\r\nRotten 28%\r\nThough arguably superior to its predecessor, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is overwhelmed by its nonstop action and too nonsensical and vapid to leave a lasting impression.\r\n\r\n### G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009)\r\nRotten 35%\r\nWhile fans of the Hasbro toy franchise may revel in a bit of nostalgia, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is largely a cartoonish, over-the-top action fest propelled by silly writing, inconsistent visual effects, and merely passable performances.\r\n\r\n### Gladiator (2000)\r\nCertified Fresh 76%\r\nRidley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.\r\n\r\n### Godzilla (2014)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gravity (2013)\r\nCertified Fresh 97%\r\nAlfonso Cuaron's Gravity is an eerie, tense sci-fi thriller that's masterfully directed and visually stunning.\r\n\r\n### Hancock (2008)\r\nRotten 41%\r\nThough it begins with promise, Hancock suffers from a flimsy narrative and poor execution.\r\n\r\n### Hannibal (2001)\r\nRotten 39%\r\nWhile superbly acted and stylishly filmed, Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing.\r\n\r\n### Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (2010)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nIt can't help but feel like the prelude it is, but Deathly Hallows: Part I is a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series.\r\n\r\n### Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 88%\r\nThe main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.\r\n\r\n### Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\r\nCertified Fresh 84%\r\nDark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.\r\n\r\n### Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\r\nCertified Fresh 79%\r\nIt's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.\r\n\r\n### Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)\r\nCertified Fresh 91%\r\nUnder the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.\r\n\r\n### Hereafter (2010)\r\nRotten 46%\r\nDespite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, Hereafter fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.\r\n\r\n### Hollow Man (2000)\r\nRotten 27%\r\nDespite awesome special effects, Hollow Man falls short of other films directed by Paul Verhoeven. This flick over time degenerates into a typical horror film.\r\n\r\n### I Am Legend (2007)\r\nFresh 70%\r\nI Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith's mesmerizing performance.\r\n\r\n### I, Robot (2004)\r\nRotten 58%\r\nBearing only the slightest resemblance to Isaac Asimov's short stories, I, Robot is a summer blockbuster that manages to make the audience think, if only for a little bit.\r\n\r\n### Inception (2010)\r\nCertified Fresh 86%\r\nSmart, innovative, and thrilling, Inception is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually.\r\n\r\n### Independence Day (1996)\r\nFresh 60%\r\nThe plot is thin and so is character development, but as a thrilling, spectacle-filled summer movie, Independence Day delivers.\r\n\r\n### Iron Man (2008)\r\nCertified Fresh 93%\r\nDirector Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey make this smart, high impact superhero movie one that even non-comics fans can enjoy.\r\n\r\n### Iron Man 2 (2010)\r\nCertified Fresh 73%\r\nIt isn't quite the breath of fresh air that Iron Man was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot.\r\n\r\n### Iron Man 3 (2013)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nWith the help of its charismatic lead, some impressive action sequences, and even a few surprises, Iron Man 3 is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon.\r\n\r\n### Jack the Giant Slayer (2013)\r\nRotten 52%\r\nIt's enthusiastically acted and reasonably fun, but Jack the Giant Slayer is also overwhelmed by digital effects and a bland, impersonal story.\r\n\r\n### John Carter (2012)\r\nRotten 51%\r\nWhile John Carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills, it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization.\r\n\r\n### Jumanji (1995)\r\nRotten 50%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Jurassic Park (1993)\r\nCertified Fresh 93%\r\nJurassic Park is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since Jaws.\r\n\r\n### Jurassic Park III (2001)\r\nRotten 49%\r\nThe dinos are as cool as ever, but there's too much of a \"been there, done that\" feel.\r\n\r\n### King Kong (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 84%\r\nFeaturing state-of-the-art special effects, terrific performances, and a majestic sense of spectacle, Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong is a potent epic that's faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original.\r\n\r\n### Kung Fu Hustle (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 90%\r\nKung Fu Hustle blends special effects, martial arts, and the Looney Toons to hilarious effect.\r\n\r\n### Life of Pi (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 87%\r\nA 3D adaptation of a supposedly \"unfilmable\" book, Ang Lee's Life of Pi achieves the near impossible -- it's an astonishing technical achievement that's also emotionally rewarding.\r\n\r\n### Live Free or Die Hard (2007)\r\nCertified Fresh 81%\r\nLive Free or Die Hard may be preposterous, but it's an efficient, action-packed summer popcorn flick with thrilling stunts and a commanding performance by Bruce Willis. Fans of the previous Die Hard films will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n### Looper (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 93%\r\nAs thought-provoking as it is thrilling, Looper delivers an uncommonly smart, bravely original blend of futuristic sci-fi and good old-fashioned action.\r\n\r\n### The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\r\nCertified Fresh 91%\r\nFull of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.\r\n\r\n### The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)\r\nCertified Fresh 94%\r\nVisually breathtaking and emotionally powerful,  The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is a moving and satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.\r\n\r\n### Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Rings & Two Towers (Double Bill) (2003)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Man of Steel (2013)\r\nRotten 56%\r\nMan of Steel provides exhilarating action and spectacle to overcome its detours into generic blockbuster territory.\r\n\r\n### Mars Attacks! (1996)\r\nRotten 52%\r\nTim Burton's alien invasion spoof faithfully recreates the wooden characters and schlocky story of cheesy '50s sci-fi and Ed Wood movies -- perhaps a little too faithfully for audiences.\r\n\r\n### Men in Black III (2012)\r\nFresh 70%\r\nIt isn't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise, but Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n### Men in Black II (2002)\r\nRotten 39%\r\nLacking the freshness of the first movie, MIB 2 recycles elements from its predecessor with mixed results.\r\n\r\n### Men in Black III (2012)\r\nFresh 70%\r\nIt isn't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise, but Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n### Minority Report (2002)\r\nCertified Fresh 91%\r\nThought-provoking and visceral, Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci-fi thriller.\r\n\r\n### Monsters (2010)\r\nFresh 72%\r\nIt doesn't quite live up to its intriguing premise, but Monsters is a surprising blend of alien-invasion tropes, political themes, and relationship drama.\r\n\r\n### Now You See Me (2013)\r\nRotten 50%\r\nNow You See Me's thinly sketched characters and scattered plot rely on sleight of hand from the director to distract audiences.\r\n\r\n### Oblivion (2013)\r\nRotten 53%\r\nVisually striking but thinly scripted, Oblivion benefits greatly from its strong production values and an excellent performance from Tom Cruise.\r\n\r\n### Olympus Has Fallen (2013)\r\nRotten 48%\r\nIt's far from original, but Olympus Has Fallen benefits from Antoine Fuqua's tense direction and a strong performance from Gerard Butler -- which might just be enough for action junkies.\r\n\r\n### Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)\r\nRotten 59%\r\nIt suffers from some tonal inconsistency and a deflated sense of wonder, but Oz the Great and Powerful still packs enough visual dazzle and clever wit to be entertaining in its own right.\r\n\r\n### Pacific Rim (2013)\r\nFresh 71%\r\nIt may sport more style than substance, but Pacific Rim is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun.\r\n\r\n### Pearl Harbor (2000)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010)\r\nRotten 49%\r\nThough it may seem like just another Harry Potter knockoff, Percy Jackson benefits from a strong supporting cast, a speedy plot, and plenty of fun with Greek mythology.\r\n\r\n### Piranha (1978)\r\nFresh 72%\r\n\r\n\r\nBoo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"total\":0,\"movies\":[],\"links\":{\"self\":\"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies.json?q=Piranha+3DD+%282012%29&page_limit=1&page=1\"},\"link_template\":\"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies.json?q={search-term}&page_limit={results-per-page}&page={page-number}\"}\r\n### Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End (2007)\r\nRotten 44%\r\nPOTC: AWE provides the thrilling action scenes, but mixes in too many characters with too many incomprehensible plot threads.\r\n\r\n### Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)\r\nRotten 54%\r\nGone is Depp's unpredictability and much of the humor and originality of the first movie.\r\n\r\n### Poseidon (2006)\r\nRotten 33%\r\nThis remake of The Poseidon Adventure delivers dazzling special effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that any of the budget was left over to devote to the script.\r\n\r\n### Prometheus (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 73%\r\nRidley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to Alien may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances -- particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android.\r\n\r\n### Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\r\nCertified Fresh 95%\r\nFeaturing bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.\r\n\r\n### Real Steel (2011)\r\nFresh 60%\r\nSilly premise notwithstanding, this is a well-made Hollywood movie: Thrilling and exciting action with just enough characterization.\r\n\r\n### Reign of Fire (2002)\r\nRotten 40%\r\nAn enjoyable B-movie if you don't use your brain.\r\n\r\n### Riddick (2013)\r\nRotten 58%\r\nIt may not win the franchise many new converts, but this back-to-basics outing brings Riddick fans more of the brooding sci-fi action they've come to expect.\r\n\r\n### Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes 3 (2016)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Saving Private Ryan (1998)\r\nCertified Fresh 92%\r\nAnchored by another winning performance from Hanks, Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre.\r\n\r\n### Shaolin Soccer (2004)\r\nCertified Fresh 91%\r\nThe plot is utterly ridiculous, and the soccer in the movie is unlike any ever played anywhere on Earth, but watching Shaolin Soccer, you will probably find it impossible to care.\r\n\r\n### Sharknado (2013)\r\nFresh 82%\r\nProudly, shamelessly, and gloriously brainless, Sharknado redefines \"so bad it's good\" for a new generation.\r\n\r\n### Sin City (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nVisually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, Sin City brings the dark world of Frank Miller's graphic novel to vivid life.\r\n\r\n### Snakes on a Plane (2006)\r\nFresh 68%\r\nSnakes on a Plane lives up to its title, featuring snakes on a plane. It isn't perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be.\r\n\r\n### Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)\r\nRotten 48%\r\nWhile it offers an appropriately dark take on the fairy tale that inspired it, Snow White and the Huntsman is undone by uneven acting, problematic pacing, and a confused script.\r\n\r\n### The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)\r\n -1%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Spider-Man 3 (2007)\r\nFresh 63%\r\nThough there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.\r\n\r\n### Stalingrad (2013)\r\nRotten 48%\r\nThere's no arguing with its impressive production values, but Stalingrad should have devoted more attention to the screenplay and spent less on special effects-enhanced spectacle.\r\n\r\n### Star Trek (2009)\r\nCertified Fresh 95%\r\nStar Trek reignites a classic franchise with action, humor, a strong story, and brilliant visuals, and will please traditional Trekkies and new fans alike.\r\n\r\n### Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)\r\nCertified Fresh 87%\r\nVisually spectacular and suitably action packed, Star Trek Into Darkness is a rock-solid installment in the venerable sci-fi franchise, even if it's not as fresh as its predecessor.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)\r\nRotten 57%\r\nLucas needs to improve on the plot and character development, but there's plenty of eye candy to behold.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones 3D (2002)\r\nFresh 67%\r\nThough it still suffers from an overabundance of exposition, the action quotient is upped considerably in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, which makes it an improvement over The Phantom Menace.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith 3D (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 80%\r\nThis sixth and final installment of George Lucas' epic space opera will please die-hard fanatics and non-believers alike -- largely due to awesome digital effects and the sheer power of the mythology.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)\r\nCertified Fresh 93%\r\nA legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possiblites of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\r\nCertified Fresh 96%\r\nDark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.\r\n\r\n### Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)\r\nCertified Fresh 78%\r\nThough failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, Return of the Jedi remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy.\r\n\r\n### Sucker Punch (2011)\r\nRotten 23%\r\nIt's technically impressive and loaded with eye-catching images, but without characters or a plot to support them, all of Sucker Punch's visual thrills are for naught.\r\n\r\n### Super 8 (2011)\r\nCertified Fresh 82%\r\nIt may evoke memories of classic summer blockbusters a little too eagerly for some, but Super 8 has thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth to spare.\r\n\r\n### Superman Returns (2006)\r\nCertified Fresh 76%\r\nBryan Singer's reverent and visually decadent adaptation gives the Man of Steel welcome emotional complexity. The result: a satisfying stick-to-your-ribs adaptation.\r\n\r\n### Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\r\nCertified Fresh 92%\r\nT2 features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/ action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters.\r\n\r\n### Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (2003)\r\nFresh 70%\r\nAlthough T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.\r\n\r\n### Terminator Salvation (2009)\r\nRotten 33%\r\nWith storytelling as robotic as the film's iconic villains, Terminator Salvation offers plenty of great effects but lacks the heart of the original films.\r\n\r\n### The Abyss (1989)\r\nCertified Fresh 88%\r\nThe utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that The Abyss is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.\r\n\r\n### The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 73%\r\nA well-chosen cast and sure-handed direction allow The Amazing Spider-Man to thrill, despite revisiting many of the same plot points from 2002's Spider-Man.\r\n\r\n### Marvel's The Avengers (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 92%\r\nWith a script that never forgets its heroes' humanity and no shortage of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype -- and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.\r\n\r\n### The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008)\r\nFresh 67%\r\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is an entertaining family adventure worthy of the standard set by its predecessor.\r\n\r\n### The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005)\r\nCertified Fresh 76%\r\nWith first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.\r\n\r\n### The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010)\r\nRotten 49%\r\nIts leisurely, businesslike pace won't win the franchise many new fans, but Voyage of the Dawn Treader restores some of the Narnia franchise's lost luster with strong performances and impressive special effects.\r\n\r\n### The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)\r\nCertified Fresh 72%\r\nCurious Case of Benjamin Button is an epic fantasy tale with rich storytelling backed by fantastic performances.\r\n\r\n### The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 88%\r\nThe Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful, and potent action film that concludes Christopher Nolan's franchise in spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\n### The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 88%\r\nThe Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful, and potent action film that concludes Christopher Nolan's franchise in spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\n### The Day After Tomorrow (2004)\r\nRotten 45%\r\nA ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster.\r\n\r\n### The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)\r\nRotten 21%\r\nHeavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base, The Day the Earth Stood Still is subpar re-imagining of the 1951 science-fiction classic.\r\n\r\n### The Fifth Element (1997)\r\nFresh 71%\r\nVisually inventive and gleefully over the top, Luc Besson's The Fifth Element is a fantastic piece of pop sci-fi that never takes itself too seriously.\r\n\r\n### The Final Destination (2009)\r\nRotten 29%\r\nWith little of the ingenuity of previous installments, The Final Destination is predictable, disposable horror fare.\r\n\r\n### The Golden Compass (2007)\r\nRotten 42%\r\nWithout the bite or the controversy of the source material, The Golden Compass is reduced to impressive visuals overcompensating for lax storytelling.\r\n\r\n### The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)\r\nFresh 65%\r\nPeter Jackson's return to Middle-earth is an earnest, visually resplendent trip, but the film's deliberate pace robs the material of some of its majesty.\r\n\r\n### The Hunger Games (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 84%\r\nThrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.\r\n\r\n### The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)\r\nCertified Fresh 89%\r\nSmart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.\r\n\r\n### The Impossible (2012)\r\nCertified Fresh 81%\r\nThe screenplay isn't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting, but with such an astonishing real-life story at its center, The Impossible is never less than compelling.\r\n\r\n### The Incredible Hulk (2008)\r\nFresh 67%\r\nThe Incredible Hulk provides the action and excitement to please comic book fans and re-ignite this fledgling franchise.\r\n\r\n### The Lawnmower Man (1992)\r\nRotten 45%\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Lone Ranger (2013)\r\nRotten 30%\r\nArmie Hammer and Johnny Depp make for an appealing pair of leads, but they're not enough to make up for The Lone Ranger's bland script, bloated length, and blaring action overkill.\r\n\r\n### The Matrix (1999)\r\nCertified Fresh 87%\r\nAn ingenious combination of Hong Kong action, ground-breaking Hollywood FX, and an imaginative vision.\r\n\r\n### The Matrix Reloaded (2003)\r\nCertified Fresh 73%\r\nA worthy sequel even if it is a little heady and less satifying than the first Matrix.\r\n\r\n### The Matrix Revolutions (2003)\r\nRotten 36%\r\nA disappointing conclusion to the Matrix trilogy as characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.\r\n\r\n### The Mist (2007)\r\nFresh 73%\r\nFrank Darabont's impressive camerawork and politically incisive script make The Mist a truly frightening experience.\r\n\r\n### The Perfect Storm (2000)\r\nRotten 47%\r\nWhile the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers from any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else.\r\n\r\n### The Wolverine (2013)\r\nFresh 69%\r\nAlthough its final act succumbs to the usual cartoonish antics, The Wolverine is one superhero movie that manages to stay true to the comics while keeping casual viewers entertained.\r\n\r\n### This Is the End (2013)\r\nCertified Fresh 83%\r\nEnergetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in This Is the End loosely written script.\r\n\r\n### Thor (2011)\r\nCertified Fresh 77%\r\nA dazzling blockbuster that tempers its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and human drama, Thor is mighty Marvel entertainment.\r\n\r\n### Thor: The Dark World (2013)\r\nFresh 65%\r\nIt may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but Thor: The Dark World still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect.\r\n\r\n### Titanic (1997)\r\nCertified Fresh 88%\r\nA mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\r\n\r\n### Total Recall (2012)\r\nRotten 30%\r\nWhile it boasts some impressive action sequences, Total Recall lacks the intricate plotting, wry humor, and fleshed out characters that made the original a sci-fi classic.\r\n\r\n### Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)\r\nRotten 20%\r\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.\r\n\r\n### Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)\r\nRotten 36%\r\nIts special effects -- and 3D shots -- are undeniably impressive, but they aren't enough to fill up its loud, bloated running time, or mask its thin, indifferent script.\r\n\r\n### Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)\r\nRotten 20%\r\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.\r\n\r\n### Tron Legacy (2010)\r\nRotten 51%\r\nTron Legacy boasts dazzling visuals, but its human characters and story get lost amidst its state-of-the-art production design.\r\n\r\n### Twister (1996)\r\nRotten 58%\r\nA high-concept blockbuster that emphasizes special effects over three-dimensional characters, Twister's visceral thrills are often offset by the film's generic plot.\r\n\r\n### Underworld Awakening (2012)\r\nRotten 26%\r\nThere's more vapid action and less story in Underworld Awakening than previous installments, making the whole affair feel inconsequential.\r\n\r\n### Virtuosity (1995)\r\nRotten 33%\r\n\r\n\r\n### War of the Worlds (2005)\r\nFresh 74%\r\nSteven Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.\r\n\r\n### White House Down (2013)\r\nRotten 50%\r\nWhite House Down benefits from the leads' chemistry, but director Roland Emmerich smothers the film with narrative cliches and choppily edited action.\r\n\r\n### World War Z (2013)\r\nFresh 67%\r\nIt's uneven and diverges from the source book, but World War Z still brings smart, fast-moving thrills and a solid performance from Brad Pitt to the zombie genre.\r\n\r\n### Wrath of the Titans (2012)\r\nRotten 25%\r\nIts 3D effects are an improvement over its predecessor's, but in nearly every other respect, Wrath of the Titans fails to improve upon the stilted acting, wooden dialogue, and chaos-driven plot of the franchise's first installment.\r\n\r\n### X-Men Origins - Wolverine (2009)\r\nRotten 38%\r\nThough Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative.\r\n\r\n### X2: X-Men United (2003)\r\nCertified Fresh 87%\r\nTightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2: X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor -- and a benchmark for comic sequels in general.\r\n\r\n### X-Men: First Class (2011)\r\nCertified Fresh 87%\r\nWith a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, X-Men: First Class is a welcome return to form for the franchise.\r\n\r\n### X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)\r\nRotten 57%\r\nDirector Brett Ratner has replaced the heart and emotion (and character development) of the previous X-Men films with more action and explosions. The film should still provide ample entertainment, but viewers may truly wish this to be the Last Stand.\r\n","google":"UA-12878248-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
