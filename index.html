<p>Rotten 8%
With attention strictly paid to style instead of substance, or historical accuracy, 10,000 B.C. is a visually impressive but narratively flimsy epic.</p>

After Earth is a dull, ploddingly paced exercise in sentimental sci-fi -- and the latest setback for director M. Night Shyamalan's once-promising career.</p>

<p>Certified Fresh 93%
Children of Men works on every level: as a violent chase thriller, a fantastical cautionary tale, and a sophisticated human drama about societies struggling to live. This taut and thought-provoking tale may not have the showy special effects normally found in movies of this genre, but you won't care one bit after the story kicks in, about a dystopic future where women can no longer conceive and hope lies within one woman who holds the key to humanity's survival. It will have you riveted.</p>

A goofy, old-school sword-and-sandal epic, Clash of the Titans mines Greek mythology for its story and fleshes it out with Ray Harryhausen's charmingly archaic stop-motion animation techniques.</p>

<p>Rotten 35%

<p>Fresh 65%
It may not be the finest film to come from the Marvel Universe, but Thor: The Dark World still offers plenty of the humor and high-stakes action that fans have come to expect.</p>

<h3>
<a name="titanic-1997" class="anchor" href="#titanic-1997"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Titanic (1997)</h3>

<p>Certified Fresh 88%
A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.</p>

<h3>
<a name="total-recall-2012" class="anchor" href="#total-recall-2012"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Total Recall (2012)</h3>

<p>Rotten 30%
While it boasts some impressive action sequences, Total Recall lacks the intricate plotting, wry humor, and fleshed out characters that made the original a sci-fi classic.</p>

<h3>
<a name="transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2009" class="anchor" href="#transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2009"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</h3>

<p>Rotten 20%
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="transformers-dark-of-the-moon-2011" class="anchor" href="#transformers-dark-of-the-moon-2011"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)</h3>

<p>Rotten 36%
Its special effects -- and 3D shots -- are undeniably impressive, but they aren't enough to fill up its loud, bloated running time, or mask its thin, indifferent script.</p>

<h3>
<a name="transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2009-1" class="anchor" href="#transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-2009-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</h3>

<p>Rotten 20%
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="tron-legacy-2010" class="anchor" href="#tron-legacy-2010"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tron Legacy (2010)</h3>

<p>Rotten 51%
Tron Legacy boasts dazzling visuals, but its human characters and story get lost amidst its state-of-the-art production design.</p>

<h3>
<a name="twister-1996" class="anchor" href="#twister-1996"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Twister (1996)</h3>

<p>Rotten 58%
A high-concept blockbuster that emphasizes special effects over three-dimensional characters, Twister's visceral thrills are often offset by the film's generic plot.</p>

<h3>
<a name="underworld-awakening-2012" class="anchor" href="#underworld-awakening-2012"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Underworld Awakening (2012)</h3>

<p>Rotten 26%
There's more vapid action and less story in Underworld Awakening than previous installments, making the whole affair feel inconsequential.</p>

<h3>
<a name="virtuosity-1995" class="anchor" href="#virtuosity-1995"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtuosity (1995)</h3>

<p>Rotten 33%</p>

<h3>
<a name="war-of-the-worlds-2005" class="anchor" href="#war-of-the-worlds-2005"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>War of the Worlds (2005)</h3>

<p>Fresh 74%
Steven Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.</p>

<h3>
<a name="white-house-down-2013" class="anchor" href="#white-house-down-2013"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>White House Down (2013)</h3>

<p>Rotten 50%
White House Down benefits from the leads' chemistry, but director Roland Emmerich smothers the film with narrative cliches and choppily edited action.</p>

<h3>
<a name="world-war-z-2013" class="anchor" href="#world-war-z-2013"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>World War Z (2013)</h3>

<p>Fresh 67%
It's uneven and diverges from the source book, but World War Z still brings smart, fast-moving thrills and a solid performance from Brad Pitt to the zombie genre.</p>

<h3>
<a name="wrath-of-the-titans-2012" class="anchor" href="#wrath-of-the-titans-2012"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wrath of the Titans (2012)</h3>

<p>Rotten 25%
Its 3D effects are an improvement over its predecessor's, but in nearly every other respect, Wrath of the Titans fails to improve upon the stilted acting, wooden dialogue, and chaos-driven plot of the franchise's first installment.</p>

<h3>
<a name="x-men-origins---wolverine-2009" class="anchor" href="#x-men-origins---wolverine-2009"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>X-Men Origins - Wolverine (2009)</h3>

<p>Rotten 38%
Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative.</p>

<h3>
<a name="x2-x-men-united-2003" class="anchor" href="#x2-x-men-united-2003"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>X2: X-Men United (2003)</h3>

<p>Certified Fresh 87%
Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2: X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor -- and a benchmark for comic sequels in general.</p>

<h3>
<a name="x-men-first-class-2011" class="anchor" href="#x-men-first-class-2011"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>X-Men: First Class (2011)</h3>

<p>Certified Fresh 87%
With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, X-Men: First Class is a welcome return to form for the franchise.</p>

<h3>
<a name="x-men-the-last-stand-2006" class="anchor" href="#x-men-the-last-stand-2006"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)</h3>

<p>Rotten 57%
Director Brett Ratner has replaced the heart and emotion (and character development) of the previous X-Men films with more action and explosions. The film should still provide ample entertainment, but viewers may truly wish this to be the Last Stand.</p>
