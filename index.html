      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770815449">Battle: Los Angeles (2011)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 35%</strong></p>

    <p>Overlong and overly burdened with war movie cliches, Battle: Los Angeles will entertain only the most ardent action junkies.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770858174">Battleship (2012)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 34%</strong></p>

    <p>It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but Battleship is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/155654957">Poseidon (2006)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 33%</strong></p>

    <p>This remake of The Poseidon Adventure delivers dazzling special effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that any of the budget was left over to devote to the script.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770676948">Terminator Salvation (2009)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 33%</strong></p>

    <p>With storytelling as robotic as the film's iconic villains, Terminator Salvation offers plenty of great effects but lacks the heart of the original films.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/14689">Virtuosity (1995)</a>
    </h3>

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/771017189">The Lone Ranger (2013)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 30%</strong></p>

    <p>Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp make for an appealing pair of leads, but they're not enough to make up for The Lone Ranger's bland script, bloated length, and blaring action overkill.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/771190127">Total Recall (2012)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 30%</strong></p>

    <p>While it boasts some impressive action sequences, Total Recall lacks the intricate plotting, wry humor, and fleshed out characters that made the original a sci-fi classic.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770685807">The Final Destination (2009)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 29%</strong></p>

    <p>With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, The Final Destination is predictable, disposable horror fare.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/771241227">G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 28%</strong></p>

    <p>Though arguably superior to its predecessor, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is overwhelmed by its nonstop action and too nonsensical and vapid to leave a lasting impression.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/10212">Clash of the Titans (2010)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 28%</strong></p>

    <p>An obviously affectionate remake of the 1981 original, Louis Leterrier's Clash of the Titans doesn't offer enough visual thrills to offset the deficiencies of its script.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/14339">Hollow Man (2000)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 27%</strong></p>

    <p>Despite awesome special effects, Hollow Man falls short of other films directed by Paul Verhoeven. This flick over time degenerates into a typical horror film.</p>

  

    <h3>

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770863877">Underworld Awakening (2012)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 26%</strong></p>

    <p>There's more vapid action and less story in Underworld Awakening than previous installments, making the whole affair feel inconsequential.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770955010">Pearl Harbor (2000)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 25%</strong></p>

    <p>Pearl Harbor tries to be the Titanic of war movies, but it's just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. The 40 minute action sequence is spectacular though.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/771208374">Wrath of the Titans (2012)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 25%</strong></p>

    <p>Its 3D effects are an improvement over its predecessor's, but in nearly every other respect, Wrath of the Titans fails to improve upon the stilted acting, wooden dialogue, and chaos-driven plot of the franchise's first installment.</p>

  

    <h3>

    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 23%</strong></p>

    <p>It's technically impressive and loaded with eye-catching images, but without characters or a plot to support them, all of Sucker Punch's visual thrills are for naught.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770675291">The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 21%</strong></p>

    <p>Heavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base, The Day the Earth Stood Still is subpar re-imagining of the 1951 science-fiction classic.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770676429">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 20%</strong></p>

    <p>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.</p>

    <p>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/771268396">After Earth (2013)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 11%</strong></p>

    <p>After Earth is a dull, ploddingly paced exercise in sentimental sci-fi -- and the latest setback for director M. Night Shyamalan's once-promising career.</p>

  

    <h3>
      <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com/m/770673701">10,000 B.C. (2008)</a>
    </h3>

    <p><strong>Rotten 8%</strong></p>

    <p>With attention strictly paid to style instead of substance, or historical accuracy, 10,000 B.C. is a visually impressive but narratively flimsy epic.</p>
